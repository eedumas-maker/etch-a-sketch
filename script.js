// for down the road, spheres can be organized on a grid of triangles with the following equation.
/*
    r = radius
    s = space between circles (10% of r perhaps)
    w = width between center of circles on a row
    h = height between center of circles 

    Array them in a grid!
    w = 2r + s (easy, two half circles and the ideal space between)
    h = w * sqRt 3 / 2 (so says an online equilateral triangle formula)
